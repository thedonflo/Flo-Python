# Custom Module Exercise
# This exercise has two files!!! ðŸ™€ . TWO FILES!
#
# Your task is to write a function in the helpers.py file, and then call it from the exercise.py file.
# More specifically:
#
# In helpers.py, define a function called lucky_number()  that always returns the number 37.  That's it.
# It always returns 37, no matter what.
#
# In exercise.py, import the helpers module.
# In order for the testing logic to work properly, don't use the 'as', or 'from' keywords when importing.
# Just do a plain old import.
#
# From inside exercise.py, call the lucky_number  function you defined in the helpers module.
# Save the result to a variable called num
#
# The point of this exercise is to get comfortable working with multiple files, and defining custom modules.
# Because of that, the testing logic actually checks to see that your code is all in the
# correct filed rather than just checking
# if you got the right answer.

#Import your helpers module here.  Do not use the 'from' or 'as' syntax, just use a plain old 'import'

#Call the lucky_number function from your helpers module, and save the result to a variable called num

import helpers

num = helpers.lucky_number()
print(num)
