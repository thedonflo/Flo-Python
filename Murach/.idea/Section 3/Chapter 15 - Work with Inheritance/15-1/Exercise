Open and test the program
1. In IDLE, open the objects.py and product_ viewer.py files in this folder:
python/ exercises/ ch15 / product_viewer
2. Review the code and run the program to make sure it works correctly. Note
that the Movie class displays the format, which is DVD, as part of the name of
the product.
Improve the Movie and Book classes
3. In the Movie class, add an attribute named format that stores the format of the
product. For example, the format could be DVD, streaming, and so on.
4. In the product_ viewer module, modify the code that creates the Movie object
so it stores "DVD" as the format attribute instead of appending this data to
the end of the name attribute. Then, modify the code that displays the Movie
object, so it displays the format on a separate line, after the year of the movie.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for the Book class. You can use "Hardcover" as the
format for the book. Or, if you prefer, you can specify a different type of book
format such as "Paperback" or "ebook".
Add an Album class
6. In the objects module, add a class named Album that inherits the Product
class. The Album class should add two attributes: one for storing the artist and
another for storing the format.
7. In the product_ viewer.py file, modify the code that creates the objects so it
includes a fo urth object, an Album object. This object should contain the
data for a music album that you like. Then, add code that displays the Album
object as shown at the beginning of this exercise.
Add a Media class
8. In the objects module, add a class named Media that inherits the Product
class. This class should add a format attribute to the Product class.
9. Modify the Movie, Book, and Album classes so they inherit the Media class,
not the Product class. This should create a class hierarchy that looks like this:
Product
Media
Movie
Book
Album
10. Modify the Movie, Book, and Album classes so the constructor of each class
accepts a format argument and passes that argument on to the constructor of
the Media class. In other words, these classes should set the format attribute
by calling the constructor of the Media class. Note how this reduces code
duplication.
11. In the product_ viewer.py file, modify the code that displays the products so
it only displays the format attribute for Media objects. Note how this reduces
code duplication.
